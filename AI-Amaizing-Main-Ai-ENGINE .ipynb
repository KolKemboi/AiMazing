A 5 meters -height wall has a cube with 1 meter side length at the down -side of the wall. \\nPlease determine the minimum length of a ladder that is laid on the wall and its’ end reaching the top \\nof the wall.  \\n4. Mathematical Model  \\nReal world problems cannot be solved with mathematics before the problem is translated into \\nmathematical language in the form of mathematical models. Therefore, the process of turning real \\nworld problems into mathematical probl ems is called mathematical modelling. This is a process of \\nmathematizing real -world problems and hence is also called a mathematical process [6, 7 ]. The steps \\nof the mathematical modelling process for solving real -world  problems are as follows (see [8, 7 ]): \\n\\uf0b7 Understanding the problem. In this step, the problem is analyzed to distinguish the information \\ngiven (givens) and the questions that must be answered (goals).  \\n\\uf0b7 Making Assumptions. For complex problems, assumptions are needed to simplify the model. The \\nsolution obtained only applies according to the assumptions made.  \\n\\uf0b7 Defining variables. All variables needed to present the problem in mathematical form are defined \\nin this step.  \\n\\uf0b7 Correlating the Variables. Equations are formed in order to connect the defined  variables by \\npaying attention to the results of the problem analysis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Building a Model. Functional relationship between variables and assumptions (if available) forms \\na mathematical model. A mathematical model can be a system of equations, a number of rul es, or \\nan algorithm of variable values.  \\n\\uf0b7 Completing the Model. By using existed techniques and methods in mathematics, the model is \\nsolved in order to get a mathematical solution of the existing problem. If necessary,  technologies \\nlike calculators and compu ters can be used to do all mathematical calculations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Interpreting the Solutions. The solution obtained is interpreted and translated back into the \\ncontext of the problem given.  \\n\\uf0b7 Verifying the Model. The modelling process does not stop at interpreting solut ions into the \\ncontext of the problem. Some questions like  “does the  solution obtained make sense? ” or“ is a \\nnew assumption model needed?” still need to be answered through a review of the produced \\nmodel that is validated with data and corrected  if necessar y in order to produce a valid model and \\nbe able to be used to study and understand problems through simulation or making predictions.  \\nThis process is illustrated schematically  in Figure 3.  \\n \\n', metadata={'source': '/content/Mathematical_Modelling_in_Problem_Solving.pdf', 'page': 4})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":76}],"source":["from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings\n","from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n","from langchain.document_loaders  import  PyPDFLoader\n","from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings\n","from langchain.llms.base import LLM\n","from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\n","import os\n","import warnings\n","import random\n","import string\n","\n","document  = PyPDFLoader(\"/content/Mathematical_Modelling_in_Problem_Solving.pdf\")\n","pages  = document.load()\n","pages[4]"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","repo_id = \"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"\n","embeddings = HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings(\n","            repo_id=repo_id,\n","            task=\"feature-extraction\"\n","\n","        )\n","text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, length_function = len,)\n","texts = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)\n","#random_str = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=10))\n","#text = page.extract_text()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f3G-KCsGwqI4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700152515752,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":569,"user":{"displayName":"Wambugu kinyua","userId":"00100449907747398592"}},"outputId":"c31d5c94-d11a-441a-e1da-0ccfa6827822"},"execution_count":77,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["You're using a different task than the one specified in the repository.

The\n","system may have a limited or unlimited capacity for holding units. A unit may arrive\n","either singly or in a batch.\n","The arrival time for any customer is unpredictable. Therefore, the arrival time and\n","the number of customers arriving at any specified time intervals are usually random\n","variables. A Poisson distribution of arrivals correspond to arrivals at random. In\n","Poisson distribution, successive customers arrive after intervals which independently\n","are and exponentially distributed. The Poisson distribution is important, as it is a\n","suitable mathematical model of many practical queuing systems as describcxl by the\n","parameter \"the average arrival rate\" .\n","The service mechanism is a denscription of resources required for service. If there are\n","infinite number of servers, then there will be no queue. If the number of servers is\n","finite, then the customers are served according to a specific order. The time taken to\n","serve a particular customer is called the service time. The time is a statistical\n","variable and can be studied either as the number of services in a given period\n","of time or the completion period of a service.\n","The queue discipline indicate the way in which units form a queue and are serviced.\n","The most common queuing discipline is First Come First Served (FCFS) or \"First-in,\n","First-out\" (FIFO). Other disciplines include \"Last In First Out\" (LIFO) where last\n","customer is serviced first, \"Service In Random Order\" (SIRO) in which the customers\n","are randomly irrespective of their arrivals. \"Priority service\" is when the\n","customers are grouped in priority classes based on urgency. \"Preemptive Priority\" is\n","the highest priority given to the customer who enters into the service, immediately,\n","even if a customer with lower priority is in sen•ice. \"Non-preemptive priority\" is where\n","the customer goes ahead in the queue, but will be served only after the completion of\n","the current service.\n","Thc system may have a single channel or S-parallel channels for The more the\n","number of service channels in the service facility, the greater the overall service rate of\n","the facility. The combination of arrival rate and service rate is critical for determining\n","the number of service channels.
