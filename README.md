# AIMazing Team - Revolutionizing Education Using Large Language Models
## Introduction

The AIMazing team is dedicated to transforming the education sector by leveraging the power of large language models. Our mission is to create innovative solutions that improve learning outcomes, enhance student engagement, and make education more accessible to everyone. We believe that artificial intelligence can play a vital role in achieving these goals, and we're excited to share our progress with you.
Background

The use of large language models has gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to process vast amounts of data and generate human-like text. Our team saw an opportunity to harness this technology to create personalized learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, and provide real-time feedback to students. We began exploring various platforms and tools to develop our idea, and we're proud to say that our backend code is now live on GitHub.
## Backend Code

Our backend code is written in Python and utilizes several popular libraries, including:
``` Bash
langchains
requests 
hugchat
opencv
pytesseract
pillow 

```

 	Here's a brief overview of the  project:  
    
	__Models Used:__ Models  used  include  ``` 
						1. Llama2  70b  chat 
						2. Codellama 34b 
						3. Falcon 180b chat  
						4. Mistrail-7b chat 
					```
					 
    __API Development:__ For  the API our  engine  is  the  unofficial huggingchat  called `hugchat`. It  is  opensource  as  the same as  the  models.
			We have  created  a custom wrapper  for the  `hugchat` unofficial api that "acts" as  our  LLM .
